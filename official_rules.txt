American checkers version

Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).

A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.

A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed during a single turn.

When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.

If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option; the jump must be made.

If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.


When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king. One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.

Kings are limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)

Kings may combine jumps in several directions, forward and backward, on the same turn. 

Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).

Draughts version 


Draughts is played on a 64 square chess board. Take 12 counters of one colour and place one on each of the black squares in the first 3 rows of your side. Your opponent does the same.


The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot be moved. 
Pieces are always moved diagonally, 1 square at a time, towards the opponent's side of the board. 
You play the entire game on the black squares, you do not need the white ones.


You can capture an enemy piece by hopping over it. Capturing is also done on the diagonal.
You have to jump from the square directly next to your target and land on the square just beyond it.
Your landing square must be vacant. The piece captured is removed from the board. If you are able to make a move that results in a capture then you must.

It is legal to capture more than 1 piece on a single move so long as the jumping piece has vacant landing spots in between.
You cannot take 2 in a row you must land and "take off" again. The pieces are removed.
If you are able to make a move that results in a capture then you must.

If you can get a piece all the way to the other side of the board, that piece becomes a king.
Place a previously captured piece on top of the existing one in order to distinguish it from your other pieces.
This piece can move backwards or forwards diagonally. Towards the end of the game all the pieces will be Kings, which changes the strategy significantly.

Capture all your opponents pieces.
